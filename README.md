# WaterDistribution
IBM Watson Studio for analysis of rainfall availability in urban areas.
A dashboard is created to send messages to flat owners using twilio when rain water
is available and when  rain water is finished,start using  municipal water  ,thus municipal water is saved.
The reports are shared with municipality.
The dashboard displays the line graphs of usage of rain water and municipal water.

Thus ,after getting an idea of water consumption in urban areas,the municipal can save water and distribute the water thus saved ,in rural areas for agriculture.
